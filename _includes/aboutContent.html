    <p class="large">I work with teams and stakeholders to understand the <strong><i>why</i></strong> in order to conceptualize, develop, and execute projects effectively and efficiently.</p>
    <p>I got started working with small mobile games, where I was introduced to graphic design. From there, I moved on to the cybersecurity industry, where I really honed my design and front-end web development skills. After Barkly, I worked with several teams, clients, and stakeholders for a healthcare technology company. Backpack Health is really where I grew into a more strategic role, taking charge of the processes and design behind our commercial and marketingâ€™s visual presence.</p>
    <p>I live in Watertown, MA with my boyfriend and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/3_gentlemen_bastards/">3 pet rats</a>. </p>
